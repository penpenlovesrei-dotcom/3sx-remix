# 3SX

3SX is a native port of *Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike*. It's a continuation of [3s-decomp](https://github.com/crowded-street/3s-decomp) – a matching decompilation of 3rd Strike for PS2. 

> [!NOTE]
> 3SX is neither a recomp, nor emulation. It's native C code running directly on your hardware with no layers in between.

# Vision

For years fans have had to resort to less-than-ideal versions of 3S:
- Fightcade is great for playing online, but the fact that it's emulation-based makes it extremely hard (if not outright impossible) to add any meaningful features, aside from Lua training modes. It's also a pain to setup controllers for tournament play. And its second-class support for Linux and macOS makes it impossible to use in certain cases.
- 3S from the 30th Anniversary Collection is largely considered a subpar version, and its player base is very low what with the lack of crossplay.
- 3rd Strike Online Edition is beloved, yet flawed and abandoned. It's impossible to play on PC (outside of emulation) or modern consoles.

On the other hand, 3SX:
- brings first-class support for Windows, macOS and Linux (with possible ports to more platforms in the future)
- fixes arcade balance regressions introduced in PS2 version, providing a truly arcade-perfect experience (WIP)
- leverages GekkoNet to provide a fast, modern, cross-platform rollback netcode implementation

Our end goal with 3SX is to make **the ultimate version of 3rd Strike**: most responsive, most convenient, most easy-to-setup, most feature-rich, most played.

## Roadmap

Our goals for version 1.0:
- a stable PC experience
- easy access to online play
- auto-updates
- arcade ROM (legally obtained) as the only dependency

To track progress towards version 1.0 check our [1.0 milestone](https://github.com/crowded-street/3sx/milestone/1). To learn about other planned features check the [Backlog](https://github.com/crowded-street/3sx/milestone/2).

## How to play
